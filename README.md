# machine-learning-algorithms
In this repo there are machine learning algorithms written in high level language(Octave/matlab). 
these can be easily converted in python language by using numpy and matplotlib library.
here, the main focus is to understand the algorithms used in machine learning.
Evrey Exercise have 1-2 different data sets on which these algorithms have been applied.....
