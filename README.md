## machine-learning-algorithms:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this repo there are machine learning algorithms written in high level language(Octave)
Evrey Exercise have 1-2 different data sets on which these algorithms have been applied..... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithms-

1. Exercise-1:Linear Regression

2. Exercise-2:Logistic Regression,

3. Exercise-3:Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks,

4. Exercise-4:Neural Networks Learning,

5. Exercise-5:Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance,

6. Exercise-6:Support Vector Machines,

7. Exercise-7:K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis

8. Exercise-8:Anomaly Detection and Recommender system.
